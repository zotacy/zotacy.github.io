    <h2>Intro to Welding</h2>
    <p>Artistic welder specializing in recycled art. My primary focus is giving new life to scrap metal, bending twisting, cutting, and fusing, until it breathes again. A rustic inhale back into the world. I've been off-and-on welding for approximately 14 years with the majority being in the past 4 years.</p>

I love going out and exploring the world, whether it being hiking in the backwoods of NC or exploring the Swiss Alps and learnign about forgein cultures. I'm all for it and already planning the next adventure!</p>
